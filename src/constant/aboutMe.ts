I’m a Backend Developer with strong experience in building scalable, secure, and high-performance backend systems using Node.js, NestJS, Python, FastAPI, and TypeScript.

My work focuses on designing robust RESTful APIs, managing databases such as PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Redis, and building real-time features, background processing, and AI-powered services. I take pride in writing maintainable, production-ready code and building systems that scale reliably.

I specialize in microservices architecture, developing large, configurable backend systems that handle complex workflows, dynamic features, and multi-module operations. My experience spans multi-language codebases, cross-functional collaboration, and delivering high-impact backend solutions.

On the DevOps side, I work with Docker, CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions), and AWS (EC2 & S3) to deploy and operate services efficiently. I’m also familiar with Nginx and Caddy for reverse proxy and server configuration.
